The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern helps in loosely coupling the instantiation process from the client code, improving maintainability and scalability.

Key Concepts of Factory Method Pattern:
1.	Factory Method: A method that encapsulates the object creation logic and allows subclasses to override it.
2.	Product (Interface or Abstract Class): Defines the common behavior of objects created by the factory.
3.	Concrete Product: Specific implementations of the product.
4.	Creator (Abstract Class or Interface): Declares the factory method.
5.	Concrete Creator: Implements the factory method to create a particular concrete product.

When to Use the Factory Method Pattern:
- When object creation logic is complex or involves dependencies. 
- When you want to delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to subclasses. 
- When you need different variants of an object but want to avoid modifying existing code. 
- When your code should be open for extension but closed for modification (Open-Closed Principle). 
- When you want to promote loose coupling and make your code more maintainable.

Advantages of Factory Method Pattern:
1.	Encapsulation of Object Creation: Clients donâ€™t need to know how objects are created.
2.	Loose Coupling: The client code depends only on an abstract interface, not concrete classes.
3.	Extensibility: You can introduce new product types without modifying the existing code.
4.	Better Code Maintainability: Factory methods keep creation logic in a single place.
5.	Supports Open-Closed Principle: New product types can be added by extending the factory rather than modifying it.

When NOT to Use the Factory Method Pattern:
- When object creation is simple: If creating an object does not require complex logic, a factory method is unnecessary. 
- When there is no variation in object creation: If the same object is always returned, a simple constructor suffices. 
- When performance is critical: Factory methods introduce additional method calls and can add slight overhead. 
- If there are no subclasses involved: If object creation does not require subclassing, a simple factory class may be a better choice.

Real-World Usage:

- Logging Framework (Different Loggers). A logging framework may support multiple loggers (ConsoleLogger, FileLogger, DatabaseLogger). A factory method can be used to create the appropriate logger instance.
- Database Connection Factories. A database connection manager can use a factory method to return the correct database connection object (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) based on configuration.
- Game Development (Enemy Creation). In a game, different types of enemies can be created using a factory method, allowing different behaviors without changing the client code.
