The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows creating different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. This pattern is particularly useful when an object has multiple optional parameters or configurations.

Key Concepts
1.	Encapsulation of Object Creation: The pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation.
2.	Step-by-Step Object Construction: The builder allows constructing objects in a controlled manner, often making the process more readable.
3.	Immutability Support: The builder pattern is commonly used to construct immutable objects.
4.	Fluent Interface: Builders often use a fluent API for method chaining.

When to Use the Builder Pattern?
- When an object has many optional parameters. 
- When creating an object requires multiple steps or configurations. 
- When the object is complex and should be constructed in a step-by-step manner. 
- When you want to enforce immutability of an object.

Advantages of the Builder Pattern

- Improves Readability & Maintainability - Easier to understand object creation. 
- Fluent Interface - Method chaining makes it intuitive. 
- Flexible Object Creation - Can add optional features step by step. 
- Supports Immutability - Object remains immutable after construction.

When Not to Use the Builder Pattern? 
- If the object has only a few properties, a constructor or factory method might be simpler. 
- If all properties are required, a constructor might be more straightforward.

Real-World Usage
- Entity Framework uses a Fluent API to configure models. 
- HttpClient in .NET follows a builder-like approach. 
- Logging Frameworks often use a builder pattern to configure logging settings.
