The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It helps enforce the principle of dependency inversion, allowing a system to be decoupled from specific implementations.

Key Concepts of the pattern:
1.	Abstract Factory (IFactory) - Declares an interface for creating a family of related objects.
2.	Concrete Factory (ConcreteFactoryA, ConcreteFactoryB) - Implements the abstract factory interface to create specific product instances.
3.	Abstract Products (IProductA, IProductB) - Declares interfaces or abstract classes for different product types.
4.	Concrete Products (ProductA1, ProductA2, ProductB1, ProductB2) - Implements the abstract product interfaces.
5.	Client - Uses the factory interface to create objects but remains independent of their concrete implementations.

When to Use the pattern:
- When a system must be independent of how its objects are created. 
- When you need to ensure that related objects are used together (consistency across product families). 
- When you want to provide a set of related objects with a common interface. 
- When you need to encapsulate object creation logic and avoid exposing complex constructors.

Advantages of the pattern:
- Encapsulation of Object Creation – Ensures object creation logic is centralized, reducing duplication. 
- Consistency Across Products – Guarantees that a family of products is used together correctly. 
- Easier Maintenance and Scalability – If a new product family is needed, only a new factory is required. 
- Promotes Dependency Inversion – The client depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

When Not to Use the pattern:
- When only a single product type is needed; a simple factory or builder pattern might be more appropriate. 
- If adding a new product requires modifying the abstract factory interface, violating the Open-Closed Principle. 
- When a large number of product families is unnecessary, as it can make the code more complex. 
- If object creation logic is not complex, a simple factory might be sufficient.
